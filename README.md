This app is fully functional. You are expected to refactor the code without changing its functionality (except for bug fixing). Most of the bugs are obvious and can be found just by using the app or by reading the code. Where it is not obvious, we've left TODO comments in the code.

Design decisions that should not be changed:
- Using JSON for data storage and model
- Using programmatic UI building (i.e. do not use Storyboard or Interface Builder)

Apart from that, you can change code that you feel is:
- buggy
- messy
- repetitive
- hard to understand/maintain
